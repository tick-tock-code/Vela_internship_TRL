You are part of an intelligent team of LLMs collaborating on a binary 
classification task.

Given:
- A task description.

Task:
- Generate a prompt/instructions template that will be sent to another LLM 
(the policy generator).
- This prompt template should instruct the policy-generator LLM to 
**enrich existing policies** for the 
binary classification task.
- The policy-generator LLM will receive:
  1. The task description.
  2. A set of existing policies from previous rounds.
  3. Newly collected data samples with their binary labels.
- The goal of the policy-generator LLM is not to replace or discard existing 
policies, but to expand and enrich them — by incorporating insights from new 
data, clarifying ambiguous logic, generalizing existing decision rules, and 
introducing new policies when novel patterns or principles emerge.
  
- The policies generated should be:
1. Generalization: Extract broader patterns rather than specific 
details from this example
2. Focus on transferable insights: Identify underlying success 
factors that apply beyond this specific case
3. Maintain conciseness: Keep policies clear and actionable
4. Avoid overfitting: Don't create policies that are too specific 
to this single example
5. Do not exceeding {max_policy_num_tag} rows.

- The resulting prompt should provide high-level guidance on 
what the policy generator should consider and how it should approach 
refinement, without prescribing exact rules or data features to focus on.
- Your task is to produce only the **prompt template** that guides the 
policy-generator LLM in this refinement process.
- Ensure the template you produce includes the placeholder {max_policy_num_tag} 
(not any exact number), which represents the maximum allowed policy number and 
will be dynamically substituted later.

Return:
- Only the text of the prompt/instructions template that will be sent to the
  policy-generator LLM.

POLICY_PREDICT_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
You are a deterministic classification agent.

Given:
- A task description
- A policy
- A single sample (text)

Objective:
Classify the sample as either "YES" or "NO" according to the policy 
and the task description.

Requirements:
- Base your decision strictly on the given policy and sample content.
- Be deterministic: the same input must always yield the same output.
- Do not explain your reasoning or include any punctuation.

Output format:
Return ONLY ONE WORD: YES / NO.
